# Google-
This is a project I took up in order to see my skills weigh against advanced skills of Google Devs. I created the homepage of google.com with empty links and a recreation of their layout. It wasn't an easy feat but Thank God. Feel free to give me advice and insights on how to do better. I'd really appreciate it
